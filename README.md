The task is simple, however it requires using Qt framework. Write a QML program that shows an interactive analog clock (Something like https://toytheater.com/clock/ ):
1. Do not use Image element
2. You may use Rectangle, Repeater, Text, MouseArea
3. Do not use QtQuick.Controls
4. Minutes and Hours handle should be draggable to adjust the time

Bonus: Make the clock live with rotating seconds handle every second, minutes handle every minute, hours handle every hour accordingly ‚è∞



Once you download the file please open it using QT creator, it should work.
